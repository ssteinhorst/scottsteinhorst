    Welcome!<br><br><br>
    This is the personal site of Scott Steinhorst. I'm the one living in Salt Lake City Utah,
    there are a few of us around. Funny story.. I lived in the same city as another Scott
    Steinhorst for a while and we were both having our cars serviced at the same shop one day. The shop
    brought the other Scott's car out for me when I went to pick up mine. Amusing confusion
    followed. <br><br>
    I mostly made this page as an exercise of creating HTML and CSS without frameworks, libraries, or other shortcuts
    so please excuse any rough edges. If you would like to tell me anything at all really please drop me
    an email using the link above!<br><br>
    Professionally I am a programmer, currently working on web applications using open source technology
    although I have worked with .NET (a long time ago).<br><br>
    Outside of work I enjoy working with my hands in the garden, oil painting, camping and
    many other things.<br><br>

    Feel free to take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> or head over to my
    <a href="https://github.com/ssteinhorst">github</a> if you are into that kind of thing.
