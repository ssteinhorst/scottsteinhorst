    This is the personal site of Scott Steinhorst, the one living in Salt Lake City, Utah.
    There are a few of us around. Funny story I lived in the same city as another Scott
    Steinhorst and we were both having our cars serviced at the same shop one day. The shop
    brought the other Scott's car out for me when I went to pick up mine. Amusing confusion
    followed.
    I am a programmer, currently working on web applications using open source technology
    although I have worked with .NET (a long time ago).
    I first got interested in development as a test developer at Microsoft. Before that I
    mostly did system/network administration type of work. I found that as a developer I
    could do system and network work as well as the code that utilizes these systems which
    I have found to be very rewarding.

    Outside of work I enjoy working with my hands in the garden, oil painting, camping and
    many other things.

    Feel free to take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> or head over to my
    <a href="https://github.com/ssteinhorst">github</a> if you are into that kind of thing.
