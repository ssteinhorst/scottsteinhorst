                    During my work here I worked with Node.js to create an open source, enterprise medical health record system providing data storage, retrieval, and medical informatics providing enhanced data analysis for health care providers at the VA. This application is used in VA hospitals to provide health care data for clinicians. I also worked in .NET to create a clinician skills and work verification and validation tool. For both projects I created endpoints that provided new data, created and configured HTML front end components, models, and controllers using MVC and REST design. In addition to technical work for a time I also acted as first line triage for clinicians using the tool in a clinical setting.
