                    we developed data storage and retrieval using REST services written in Java and later Javascript.
                    These Java services communicate with a front end using Ext JS, JavaScript, and Velocity templates.
                    During my time I have added features, fixed bugs, and adjusted CSS and use cases in the app at all
                    levels in the stack. I have also built prototypes of several of our services in Node.js in
                    anticipation of converting our Java stack to Javascript. I have a Public Trust Clearance, Moderate
